remarkable experiences going wondering eminently respectable fossil friends Cambridge would believe I miraculously set familiar dinner table purpose relating I want convey disrespectful notion slight I call good learned men fossils experience people apt fossilise even University follow paths persistently I getting fossilised late stock ideas much enlarged Well I lay reflected wondered earth would end till last I ceased wonder went sleep I suppose I must slept seven eight hours getting first real rest I since night loss dhow I woke sun high heavens We still journeying pace four miles hour Peeping mist like curtains litter ingeniously fixed bearing pole I perceived infinite relief passed region eternal swamp travelling swelling grassy plains towards cup shaped hill Whether hill seen canal I know never since able discover afterwards found people give little information upon points Next I glanced men bearing They magnificent build six feet height yellowish colour Generally

Sometimes sang monotonous song I spoken singing remained almost perfectly silent light laugh never came brighten sombre evil countenances Of race could people Their language bastard Arabic yet Arabs I quite sure For one thing dark rather yellow I could say I know appearance filled sick fear I felt ashamed While I still wondering another litter came alongside mine In curtains drawn sat old man

She must obeyed meet thy wishes matter Who She must obeyed I asked curiously The old man glanced bearers answered little smile somehow sent blood heart Surely stranger son thou wilt learn soon enough pleasure see thee flesh In flesh I answered What may father wish convey But old man laughed dreadful laugh made reply What name father people I asked The name people Amahagger People Rocks And son might ask name father My name Billali And whither go father That shalt thou see sign bearers started forward run till reached litter Job reposing one leg hanging side Apparently however could make much Job presently I saw bearers trot forward Leo litter And nothing fresh occurred I yielded pleasant swaying motion litter went sleep I dreadfully tired When I woke I found passing rocky defile lava

sides great cup rocky clothed bush centre richest meadow land studded single trees magnificent growth watered meandering brooks On rich plain grazed herds goats cattle I saw sheep At first I could imagine strange spot could presently flashed upon must represent crater long extinct volcano afterwards lake ultimately drained unexplained way And I may state subsequent experience much larger otherwise similar spot I shall occasion describe I every reason believe conclusion correct What puzzled however although people moving herding goats cattle I saw signs human habitation Where live I wondered My curiosity soon destined gratified Turning left string litters followed cliffy sides crater distance half mile perhaps little less halted Seeing old gentleman adopted father Billali emerge litter I Leo Job The first thing I saw wretched Arab companion Mahomed lying exhausted ground It appeared provided litter forced run entire distance already quite worn started condition one great

politely lifted hat showed curling yellow hair slight murmur admiration Nor stop regarding critically head foot handsomest young women one wearing robe hair shade brown chestnut deliberately advanced way would winning determined quietly put arm round neck bent forward kissed lips I gave gasp expecting see Leo instantly speared Job ejaculated The hussy well I never As Leo looked slightly astonished remarking clearly got country followed customs early Christians deliberately returned embrace Again I gasped thinking something would happen surprise though young women showed traces vexation older ones men smiled slightly When came understand customs extraordinary people mystery explained It appeared direct opposition habits almost every savage race world women among Amahagger upon terms perfect equality men held binding ties Descent traced line mother individuals proud long superior female ancestry families Europe never pay attention even acknowledge man father even male parentage perfectly well known There one titular male parent tribe call Household elected immediate ruler title Father For instance man Billali father household consisted seven thousand individuals told man ever called name When woman took fancy man signified preference advancing embracing publicly way handsome exceedingly prompt young lady called Ustane embraced Leo If kissed back token accepted arrangement continued one wearied I bound however say change husbands nearly frequently might expected Nor quarrels arise least among men wives deserted favour rival accepted whole thing much accept income tax marriage laws something disputed tending good community however disagreeable may particular instances prove individual It curious observe customs mankind matter vary different countries making morality affair latitude right proper one place wrong improper another It must however understood since civilised nations appear accept axiom ceremony touchstone morality even according canons nothing immoral Amahagger custom seeing interchange embrace answers ceremony marriage know justifies things VII USTANE SINGS When kissing operation finished way none young ladies offered pet fashion though I saw one hovering round Job respectable individual evident alarm old man Billali advanced graciously waved us cave whither went followed Ustane seem inclined take hints I gave liked privacy Before gone five paces struck cave entering none Nature handiwork contrary hollowed hand man So far could judge appeared one hundred feet length fifty wide lofty resembling cathedral aisle anything

earthenware pot boiled cobs Indian corn brought young girls We almost starving I think I ever life ate satisfaction Indeed finished literally ate everything set us When done somewhat saturnine host Billali watching us perfect silence rose addressed us He said wonderful thing happened No man ever known heard white strangers arriving country People Rocks Sometimes though rarely black men come heard existence men much whiter sailed sea ships arrival precedent We however seen dragging boat canal told us frankly given orders destruction seeing unlawful stranger enter message come She must obeyed saying lives spared brought hither Pardon father I interrupted point I understand She must obeyed lives yet farther could known approach Billali turned seeing alone young lady Ustane withdrawn begun speak said curious little laugh Are none land see without eyes hear without ears Ask questions She knew I shrugged shoulders proceeded say instructions received subject disposal start interview She must obeyed generally spoken sake brevity Hiya She simply gave us understand Queen Amahagger learn wishes I asked long proposed away said travelling hard might back fifth day many miles marsh cross came She He said every arrangement would made comfort absence personally taken fancy us sincerely trusted answer bring She would one favourable continuation existence time wish conceal us thought doubtful every stranger ever come country grandmother life mother life life put death without mercy way would harrow feelings describing done order She least supposed order At rate never interfered save Why I said You old man time talk must reach back three men lives How therefore could She ordered death anybody beginning life grandmother seeing would born Again smiled faint peculiar smile deep bow departed without making answer see five days When gone discussed situation filled alarm I like accounts mysterious Queen She must obeyed shortly She apparently ordered execution unfortunate stranger fashion unmerciful Leo depressed consoled triumphantly pointing She undoubtedly person referred writing potsherd father letter proof advanced Billali allusions age power I time overwhelmed whole course events I even heart left dispute proposition absurd I suggested try go get bath stood sadly need Accordingly indicated wish middle aged individual unusually saturnine cast countenance even among saturnine people appeared deputed look us Father hamlet departed started body first lit pipes Outside cave found quite crowd people evidently watching appearance saw us come smoking vanished way calling great magicians Indeed nothing us created great sensation tobacco smoke even firearms [*] After succeeded reaching stream source strong ground spring taking bath peace though women excepting Ustane showed decided inclination follow us even [*] We found tobacco growing country every part Africa although absolutely ignorant blessed qualities Amahagger use habitually form snuff also medicinal purposes L H H By time finished refreshing bath sun setting indeed got back big cave already set The cave full people gathered round fires several lighted eating evening meal lurid light various lamps set hung upon walls These lamps rude manufacture baked earthenware shapes graceful enough The larger ones formed big red earthenware pots filled clarified melted fat reed wick stuck wooden disk filled top pot This sort lamp required constant attention prevent going whenever wick burnt means turning The smaller hand lamps however also made baked clay fitted wicks manufactured pith palm tree sometimes stem handsome variety fern This kind wick passed round hole end lamp sharp piece hard wood attached wherewith pierce draw whenever showed signs burning low For sat watched grim people eating evening meal silence grim till length getting tired contemplating huge moving shadows rocky walls I suggested new keeper like go bed Without word rose taking politely hand advanced lamp one small passages I noticed opening central cave This followed five paces suddenly widened small chamber eight feet square hewn living rock On one side chamber stone slab three feet ground running entire length like bunk cabin slab intimated I sleep There window air hole chamber furniture looking closely I came disturbing conclusion I afterwards discovered I quite right originally served sepulchre dead rather sleeping place living slab designed receive corpse departed The thought made shudder spite seeing I must sleep somewhere I got feeling best I might returned cavern get blanket brought boat things There I met Job inducted similar apartment flatly declined stop saying look place gave horrors might well dead buried grandfather brick grave expressed determination sleeping I would allow This course I glad The night passed comfortably whole I say whole personally I went horrible nightmare buried alive induced doubt sepulchral nature surroundings At dawn aroused loud trumpeting sound produced afterwards discovered young Amahagger blowing hole bored side hollowed elephant tusk kept purpose Taking hint got went stream wash morning meal served At breakfast one women longer quite young advanced publicly kissed Job I think way delightful thing putting impropriety aside moment I ever saw Never shall I forget respectable Job abject terror disgust Job like bit misogynist I fancy chiefly owing fact one family seventeen feelings expressed upon countenance realised embraced publicly without authorisation part also presence masters mixed painful admit accurate description He sprang feet pushed woman buxom person thirty Well I never gasped whereupon probably thinking coy embraced Be Get away minx shouted waving wooden spoon eating breakfast lady face Beg pardon gentlemen I sure I encouraged Oh Lord coming Hold Mr Holly please hold I stand I indeed This never happened gentlemen never There nothing character broke ran hard could go cave I saw Amahagger laugh As woman however laugh On contrary seemed bristle fury mockery women served intensify She stood literally snarling shaking indignation seeing I wished Job scruples Jericho forming shrewd guess admirable behaviour endangered throats Nor sequel shows I wrong The lady retreated Job returned great state nervousness keeping weather eye fixed upon every woman came near I took opportunity explain hosts Job married man unhappy experiences domestic relations accounted presence terror sight women remarks received grim silence evident retainer behaviour considered slight household large although women manner civilised sisters made merry rebuff companion After breakfast took walk inspected Amahagger herds also cultivated lands They two breeds cattle one large angular horns yielding beautiful milk red breed small fat excellent meat value milking purposes This last breed closely resembles Norfolk red pole strain horns generally curve forward head sometimes extent cut prevent growing bones skull The goats long haired used eating least I never saw milked As Amahagger cultivation primitive extreme done means spade made iron people smelt work iron This spade shaped like big spear head anything else shoulder foot set As consequence labour digging great It however done men women contrary habits savage races entirely exempt manual toil But I think I said elsewhere among Amahagger weaker sex established rights At first much puzzled origin constitution extraordinary race points upon singularly uncommunicative As time went next four days passed without striking event learnt something Leo lady friend Ustane way stuck young gentleman like shadow As origin none least far aware There however informed us mounds masonry many pillars near place She lived called Kocirc r wise said houses wherein men lived suggested descended men No one however dared go near great ruins haunted looked distance Other similar ruins seen heard various parts country wherever one mountains rose level swamp Also caves lived hollowed rocks men perhaps built cities They written laws custom however quite binding law If man offended custom put death order Father Household I asked put death smiled said I might see one day soon They Queen however She Queen rarely seen perhaps two three years came forth pass sentence offenders seen muffled big cloak nobody could look upon face Those waited upon deaf dumb therefore could tell tales reported lovely woman lovely ever It rumoured also immortal power things Ustane could say nothing What believed Queen chose husband time time soon female child born husband never seen put death Then female child grew took place Queen mother died buried great caves But matters none could speak certainty Only She obeyed throughout length breadth land question command instant death She kept guard regular army disobey die I asked size land many people lived She answered ten Households like knew including big Household Queen Households lived caves places resembling stretch raised country dotted vast extent swamp threaded secret paths Often Households made war She sent word stop instantly ceased That fever caught crossing swamps prevented numbers increasing much They connection race indeed none lived near able thread vast swamps Once army direction great river presumably Zambesi attempted attack got lost marshes night seeing great balls fire move tried come thinking marked enemy camp half drowned As rest soon died fever starvation blow struck The marshes told us absolutely impassable except knew paths adding I could well believe never reached place brought thither These many things learnt Ustane four days pause real adventures began may imagined gave us considerable cause thought The whole thing exceedingly remarkable almost incredibly indeed oddest part far less correspond ancient writing sherd And appeared mysterious Queen clothed rumour dread wonderful attributes commonly known impersonal mind rather awesome title She Altogether I could make could Leo though course exceedingly triumphant I persistently mocked whole thing As Job long since abandoned attempt call reason left drift upon sea circumstance Mahomed Arab way treated civilly indeed chilling contempt Amahagger I discovered great fright though I could quite make frightened He would sit crouched corner cave day long calling upon Allah Prophet protect When I pressed said afraid people men women devils enchanted land upon word twice since I inclined agree And time went till night fourth day Billali left something happened We three Ustane sitting round fire cave bedtime suddenly woman brooding silence rose laid hand upon Leo golden curls addressed Even I shut eyes I see proud imperial form clothed alternately dense shadow red flickering fire stood wild centre weird scene I ever witnessed delivered burden thoughts forebodings kind rhythmical speech ran something follows Thou art chosen I waited thee beginning Thou art beautiful Who hath hair like unto thee skin white Who hath strong arm much man Thine eyes sky light stars Thou art perfect happy face heart turned towards thee Ay mine eyes fell upon thee I desire thee Then I take thee oh thou Beloved And hold thee fast lest harm come unto thee Ay I cover thine head mine hair lest sun strike And altogether I thine thou wast altogether mine And went little space till Time labour evil Day And befell day Alas Beloved I know But I I saw thee I I lost blackness And stronger take thee ay fairer Ustane Yet didst thou turn call upon let thine eyes wander darkness But nevertheless prevailed Beauty led thee horrible places And ah Beloved Here extraordinary woman broke speech chant much musical gibberish us understood talking seemed fix flashing eyes upon deep shadow Then moment acquired vacant terrified stare though striving realise half seen horror She lifted hand Leo head pointed darkness We looked could see nothing saw something thought something evidently affected even iron nerves without another sound fell senseless us Leo growing really attached remarkable young person great state alarm distress I perfectly candid condition far removed superstitious fear The whole scene uncanny one Presently however recovered sat extraordinary convulsive shudder What didst thou mean Ustane asked Leo thanks years tuition spoke Arabic prettily Nay chosen answered little forced laugh I sing unto thee fashion people Surely I meant nothing How could I speak yet And didst thou see Ustane I asked looking sharply face Nay answered I saw naught Ask I saw Why I fright ye And turning Leo look utter tenderness I ever saw upon face woman civilised savage took head hands kissed forehead mother might When I gone thee chosen said night thou stretchest thine hand canst find shouldst thou think times truth I love thee well though I fit wash thy feet And let us love take given us happy grave love warmth touching lips Nothing perchance perchance bitter memories might To night hours know shall belong morrow VIII THE FEAST AND AFTER On day following remarkable scene scene calculated make deep impression upon anybody beheld suggested seemed foreshadow revealed announced us feast would held evening honour I best get saying modest people cared little feasts remarks received silence displeasure I thought wisest hold tongue Accordingly sundown I informed everything ready accompanied Job went cave I met Leo usual followed Ustane These two walking somewhere knew nothing projected festivity till moment When Ustane heard I

encouragement They give creeps whole lot fact Why look asked Mahomed dine There lady mine talking nice civil way possible Well I glad We looked sure enough woman question risen escorting wretched Mahomed corner overcome acute prescience horror seated shivering calling Allah He appeared unwilling enough come reason perhaps unaccustomed honour hitherto food given apart Anyway I could see state

perfect silence staring glare glow large fire shadows thrown flickering earthenware lamps way ancient On open space us fire lay large wooden tray four short handles exactly like butcher tray hollowed By side tray great pair long handled iron pincers side fire similar pair Somehow I like appearance tray accompanying pincers There I sat stared silent circle fierce moody faces men reflected awful absolutely power alarming people rate formidable true character still much mystery us They might better I thought might worse I feared worse I wrong It curious sort feast I reflected appearance indeed

everybody circle answered deep measured tone stretching right arm towards fire spoke The flesh come Is goat said man It goat without horns goat shall slay answered one voice turning half round one grasped handles spears right hand simultaneously let go Is ox said man It ox without horns ox shall slay answer spears grasped let go Then came pause I noticed horror rising hair woman next Mahomed

tormenters springing high air fell dying upon corpse The heavy bullet pistol driven bodies striking murderess saving victim death hundred times horrible It awful yet merciful accident For moment

motion cause wound scarcely skinned break open Indeed Billali evident anxiety get led us suspect difficulty danger might threaten us comply I would consented go X SPECULATIONS Within hour finally deciding start five litters brought door cave accompanied four regular bearers two spare hands also band fifty armed Amahagger form escort carry baggage Three litters course us one Billali I immensely relieved hear companion fifth I presumed use Ustane Does lady go us father I asked Billali stood superintending things general He shrugged shoulders answered If wills In country women please We worship give way without world could go source life Ah I said matter never struck quite light We worship went point till last get unbearable added every second generation And I asked curiosity Then answered faint smile rise kill old ones example young ones show strongest My poor wife killed way three years ago It sad tell thee truth son life happier since age protects young ones In short I replied quoting saying great man whose wisdom yet lightened darkness Amahagger thou hast found thy position one greater freedom less responsibility This phrase puzzled little first vagueness though I think translation hit sense well last saw appreciated Yes yes Baboon said I see responsibilities killed least old women Well brought As girl went graver tone I know say She brave girl loves Lion Leo thou sawest clung saved life Also according custom wed right go goes unless added significantly She would say word overrides rights And She bade leave girl refused What If said shrug hurricane bids tree bend happens And without waiting answer turned walked litter ten minutes time well way It took us hour cross cup volcanic plain another half hour climb edge farther side Once however view fine

teal coot snipe plover swarmed around us many varieties quite new tame one could almost knocked stick Among birds I especially noticed beautiful variety painted snipe almost size woodcock flight

deadly cobra puff adder The bull frogs also large voices proportionate size mosquitoes musqueteers Job called possible even worse river tormented us greatly Undoubtedly however worst feature swamp

Presently rolled blankets tried go sleep far I concerned bull frogs extraordinary roaring alarming sound produced hundreds snipe hovering high air made sleep impossibility say nothing discomforts I turned looked Leo next dozing face flushed appearance I like flickering fire light I saw Ustane lying side raise time time upon elbow look anxiously enough However I could nothing already taken good

Heaven worst also prove kindly mockery given hold us despair gently lowered abysses eternal sleep Then I fell reflecting upon undertaking bent wild one yet strangely story seemed fit written centuries

feet preferred remain cave amongst society cannibals This surely settled question The whole story monstrous worthy superstitious days written At rate I sure I would attempt attain unending life I far many worries disappointments secret bitternesses forty odd years existence wish state affairs continued indefinitely And yet I suppose life comparatively speaking happy one And reflecting present moment far likelihood earthly careers cut exceedingly short unduly prolonged I last managed get sleep fact anybody reads narrative anybody ever may probably thankful When I woke dawning guard bearers moving like ghosts dense morning mists getting ready start The fire died quite I rose stretched shivering every limb damp cold dawn Then I looked Leo He sitting holding hands head I saw face flushed eye bright yet yellow round pupil Well Leo I said feel I feel though I going die answered hoarsely My head splitting body trembling I sick cat I whistled I whistle I felt inclined Leo got sharp attack fever I went Job asked quinine fortunately still good supply find Job much better He complained pains across back dizziness almost incapable helping Then I thing possible circumstances gave ten grains quinine took slightly smaller dose matter precaution After I found Billali explained matters stood asking time thought best done He came looked Leo Job way named Pig account fatness round face small eyes Ah said earshot fever I thought The Lion badly young may live As Pig attack bad little fever always begins pains across back spend upon fat Can go father I asked Nay son must go If stop certainly die also better litters ground By night goes well shall across marsh good air Come let us lift litters start bad stand still morning fog We eat meal go This accordingly heavy heart I set upon strange journey For first three hours went well could expected accident happened nearly lost us pleasure company venerable friend Billali whose litter leading cavalcade We going particularly dangerous stretch quagmire bearers sometimes sank knees Indeed mystery contrived carry heavy litters ground traversing though two spare hands well four regular ones course put shoulders pole Presently blundered floundered along sharp cry storm exclamations last tremendous splash whole caravan halted I jumped litter ran forward About twenty yards ahead edge one sullen peaty pools I spoken path following running along top bank happened steep one Looking towards pool horror I saw Billali litter floating Billali nowhere seen To make matters clear I may well explain happened One Billali bearers unfortunately trodden basking snake bitten leg whereon unnaturally let go pole finding tumbling bank grasped litter save The result might expected The litter pulled edge bank bearers let go whole thing including Billali man bitten rolled slimy pool When I got edge water neither seen indeed unfortunate bearer never seen Either struck head something got wedged mud possibly snake bite paralyzed At rate vanished But though Billali seen whereabouts clear enough agitation floating litter bearing cloth curtains entangled He Our father said one men stir finger help others They simply stood stared water Out way brutes I shouted English throwing hat I took run sprang well horrid slimy looking pool A couple strokes took Billali struggling beneath cloth Somehow I quite know I managed push free venerable head covered green slime like yellowish Bacchus ivy leaves emerged upon surface water The rest easy Billali eminently practical individual common sense grasp hold drowning people often I got arm towed bank mud [ ] difficulty dragged Such filthy spectacle presented I never seen since perhaps give idea almost superhuman dignity Billali appearance I say coughing half drowned covered mud green slime beautiful beard coming dripping point like Chinaman freshly oiled pig tail still looked venerable imposing Ye dogs said addressing bearers soon sufficiently recovered speak ye left father drown Had stranger son Baboon assuredly I drowned Well I remember fixed gleaming though slightly watery eye way I saw like though tried appear sulkily indifferent As thee son old man went turning towards grasping hand rest assured I thy friend good evil Thou hast saved life perchance day may come I shall save thine After cleaned best could fished litter went minus man drowned I know owing unpopular character native indifference selfishness temperament I bound say nobody seemed grieve much sudden final disappearance unless perhaps men share work XI THE PLAIN OF KÔR About hour sundown last unbounded gratitude emerged great belt marsh land swelled upwards succession rolling waves Just hither side crest first wave halted night My first act examine Leo condition It anything worse morning new distressing feature vomiting set continued till dawn Not one wink sleep I get night I passed assisting Ustane one gentle indefatigable nurses I ever saw wait upon Leo Job However air warm genial without hot mosquitoes speak Also level marsh mist lay stretched beneath us like dim smoke pall city lit wandering globes fen fire Thus seen speaking comparatively clover By dawn following morning Leo quite light headed fancied divided halves I dreadfully distressed began wonder sort sick fear end attack would Alas I heard much attacks generally terminate As I wondering Billali came said must getting especially opinion Leo reach spot could quiet proper nursing within next twelve hours life would matter day two I could agree got Leo litter started Ustane walking side keep flies see throw ground Within half hour sunrise reached top rise I spoken beautiful view broke upon gaze Beneath us rich stretch country verdant grass lovely foliage flowers In background distance far I could judge eighteen miles stood huge extraordinary mountain rose abruptly plain The base great mountain appeared consist grassy slope rising I say subsequent observation height five hundred feet level plain tremendous absolutely precipitous wall bare rock quite twelve fifteen hundred feet height The shape mountain undoubtedly volcanic origin round course segment circle visible difficult estimate exact size enormous I afterwards discovered could cover less fifty square miles ground Anything grand imposing sight presented great natural castle starting solitary grandeur level plain I never saw I suppose I never shall Its solitude added majesty towering cliffs seemed kiss sky Indeed generally speaking clothed clouds lay fleecy masses upon broad level battlements I sat hammock gazed across plain thrilling majestic sight I suppose Billali noticed brought litter alongside Behold house She must obeyed said Had ever queen throne It wonderful father I answered But enter Those cliffs look hard climb Thou shalt see Baboon Look path us What thinkest thou Thou art wise man Come tell I looked saw appeared line roadway running straight towards base mountain though covered turf There high banks side broken fairly continuous whole meaning I understand It seemed odd anybody embank roadway Well father I answered I suppose road otherwise I inclined say bed river rather I added observing extraordinary directness cutting canal Billali way none worse immersion day nodded head sagely replied Thou art right son It channel cut us place carry away water Of I sure within rocky circle mountain whither journey great lake But us wonderful arts I know naught hewed path water solid rock mountain piercing even bed lake But first cut channel thou seest across plain Then last water burst rushed channel made receive crossed plain till reached low land behind rise perchance made swamp come Then lake drained dry people whereof I speak built mighty city bed whereof naught ruins name Kocirc r yet remaineth age age hewed caves passages thou wilt see It may I answered lake fill rains water springs Nay son people wise people left drain keep clear Seest thou river right pointed fair sized stream wound away across plain four miles us That drain comes mountain wall cutting goes At first perhaps water ran canal afterwards people turned used cutting road And place one may enter great mountain I asked except drain There place answered cattle men foot may cross much labour secret A year mightest thou search shouldst never find It used year herds cattle fatting slopes mountain plain driven space within And She live always I asked come times without mountain Nay son By well great plain I examining delight varied beauty semi tropical flowers trees latter grew singly clumps three four much timber large size belonging apparently variety evergreen oak There also many palms one hundred feet high largest beautiful tree ferns I ever saw hung clouds jewelled honeysuckers great winged butterflies Wandering among trees crouching long feathered grass varieties game rhinoceroses I saw rhinoceros buffalo large herd eland quagga sable antelope beautiful bucks mention many smaller varieties game three ostriches scudded away approach like white drift gale So plentiful game last I could stand longer I single barrel sporting Martini litter Express cumbersome espying beautiful fat eland rubbing one oak like trees I jumped litter proceeded creep near I could He let come within eighty yards turned head stared preparatory running away I lifted rifle taking midway shoulder side fired I never made cleaner shot better kill small experience great buck sprang right air fell dead The bearers halted see performance gave murmur surprise unwonted compliment sullen people never appear surprised anything party guard ran cut animal As though I longing look I sauntered back litter though I habit killing eland life feeling I gone several degrees estimation Amahagger looked whole thing high class manifestation witchcraft As matter fact however I never seen eland wild state Billali received enthusiasm It wonderful son Baboon cried wonderful Thou art great man though ugly Had I seen surely I would never believed And thou sayest thou wilt teach slay fashion Certainly father I said airily nothing But I firmly made mind father Billali began fire I would without fail lie take refuge behind tree After little incident nothing happened note till hour half sundown arrived beneath shadow towering volcanic mass I already described It quite impossible describe grim grandeur appeared patient bearers toiled along bed ancient watercourse towards spot rich brown hued cliff shot precipice precipice till crown lost cloud All I say almost awed intensity lonesome solemn greatness On went bright sunny slope till last creeping shadows swallowed brightness presently began pass cutting hewn living rock Deeper deeper grew marvellous work must I say employed thousands men many years Indeed ever executed without aid blasting powder dynamite I cannot day imagine It must remain one mysteries wild land I suppose cuttings vast caves hollowed rocks pierced State undertakings people Kocirc r lived dim lost ages world case Egyptian monuments executed forced labour tens thousands captives carried indefinite number centuries But people At last reached face precipice found looking mouth dark tunnel forcibly reminded undertaken nineteenth century engineers construction railway lines Out tunnel flowed considerable stream water Indeed though I think I mentioned followed stream ultimately developed river I already described winding away right spot cutting solid rock commenced Half cutting formed channel stream half placed slightly higher level eight feet perhaps devoted purposes roadway At termination cutting however stream turned across plain followed channel At mouth cave cavalcade halted men employed lighting earthenware lamps brought Billali descending litter informed politely firmly orders She blindfolded learn secret paths bowels mountains To I course assented cheerfully enough Job much better notwithstanding journey like fancying I believe preliminary step hot potted He however little consoled I pointed hot pots hand far I knew fire heat As poor Leo turning restlessly hours deep thankfulness last dropped sleep stupor I know need blindfold The blindfolding performed binding piece yellowish linen whereof Amahagger condescended wear anything particular made dresses tightly round eyes This linen I afterwards discovered taken tombs I first supposed native manufacture The bandage knotted back head finally brought ends bound chin prevent slipping Ustane way also blindfolded I know unless fear impart secrets route us This operation performed started soon echoing sound footsteps bearers increased noise water caused reverberation confined space I knew entering bowels great mountain It eerie sensation borne along dead heart rock knew whither I getting used eerie sensations time pretty well prepared anything So I lay still listened tramp tramp bearers rushing water tried believe I enjoying Presently men set melancholy little chant I heard first night captured whaleboat effect produced voices curious quite indescribable After air began get exceedingly thick heavy much indeed I felt though I going choke till length litter took sharp turn another another sound running water ceased After air fresher turns continuous blindfolded I bewildering I tried keep map mind case might ever necessary us try escape route needless say failed utterly Another half hour passed suddenly I became aware open air I could see light bandage feel freshness face A minutes caravan halted I heard Billali order Ustane remove bandage undo Without waiting attentions I got knot mine loose looked As I anticipated passed right precipice farther side immediately beneath beetling face The first thing I noticed cliff nearly high high I say five hundred feet proved bed lake rather vast ancient crater stood much level surrounding plain For rest found huge rock surrounded cup unlike first place sojourned ten times size Indeed I could make frowning line opposite cliffs A great portion plain thus enclosed nature cultivated fenced walls stone placed keep cattle goats large herds breaking gardens Here rose great grass mounds miles away towards centre I thought I could see outline colossal ruins I time observe anything moment instantly surrounded crowds Amahagger similar every particular already familiar though spoke little pressed round us closely obscure view person lying hammock Then sudden number armed men arranged companies marshalled officers held ivory wands hands came running swiftly towards us far I could make emerged face precipice like ants burrows These men well officers robed addition usual leopard skin I gathered formed bodyguard She Their leader advanced Billali saluted placing ivory wand transversely across forehead asked question I could catch Billali answered whole regiment turned marched along side cliff cavalcade litters following track After going thus half mile halted front mouth tremendous cave measuring sixty feet height eighty wide Billali descended finally requested Job Leo course far ill anything sort I entered great cave light setting sun penetrated distance beyond reach daylight faintly illuminated lamps seemed stretch away almost immeasurable distance like gas lights empty London street The first thing I noticed walls covered sculptures bas relief sort pictorially speaking similar I described upon vases love scenes principally hunting pictures pictures executions torture criminals placing presumably red hot pot upon head showing whence hosts derived pleasant practice There battle pieces though many duels men running wrestling fact I led believe people much subject attack exterior foes either account isolation position great strength Between pictures columns stone characters formation absolutely new rate neither Greek Egyptian Hebrew Assyrian I sure They looked like Chinese writings I acquainted Near entrance cave pictures writings worn away many cases absolutely fresh perfect day sculptor ceased work The regiment guards come entrance cave formed let us pass On entering place however met man robed white bowed humbly said nothing afterwards appeared deaf mute wonderful Running right angles great cave distance twenty feet entrance smaller cave wide gallery pierced rock right left main cavern In front gallery left stood two guards circumstance I argued entrance apartments She The mouth right hand gallery unguarded along mute indicated go Walking yards passage lighted lamps came entrance chamber curtain made grass material unlike Zanzibar mat appearance hung doorway This mute drew back another profound obeisance led way good sized apartment hewn course solid rock great relief lighted means shaft pierced face precipice In room stone bedstead pots full water washing beautifully tanned leopard skins serve blankets Here left Leo still sleeping heavily stopped Ustane I noticed mute gave sharp look much say Who whose order come Then conducted us another similar room Job took two respectively occupied Billali XII SHE The first care Job seeing Leo wash put clean clothing wearing changed since loss dhow Fortunately I think I said far greater part personal baggage packed whaleboat therefore saved brought hither bearers although stores laid us barter presents natives lost Nearly clothing made well shrunk strong grey flannel excellent I found travelling places though Norfolk jacket shirt pair trousers weighed four pounds great consideration tropical country every extra ounce tells wearer warm offered good resistance rays sun best chills apt result sudden changes temperature Never shall I forget comfort wash brush clean flannels The thing wanting complete joy cake soap none Afterwards I discovered Amahagger reckon dirt among many disagreeable qualities use kind burnt earth washing purposes though unpleasant touch till one gets accustomed forms fair substitute soap By time I dressed combed trimmed black beard previous condition certainly sufficiently unkempt give weight Billali appellation Baboon I began feel uncommonly hungry Therefore I means sorry without slightest preparatory sound warning curtain entrance cave flung aside another mute young girl time announced signs I could misunderstand opening mouth pointing something ready eat Accordingly I followed next chamber yet entered I found Job also great embarrassment conducted thither fair mute Job never got advances former lady made towards suspected every girl came near similar designs These young parties way looking one sir would say apologetically I call respectable This chamber twice size sleeping caves I saw originally served refectory also probably embalming room Priests Dead I may well say hollowed caves nothing less vast catacombs tens ages mortal remains great extinct race whose monuments surrounded us first preserved art completeness never since equalled hidden away time On side particular rock chamber long solid stone table three feet wide three feet six height hewn living rock formed part still attached base These tables slightly hollowed curved inward give room knees one sitting stone ledge cut bench along side cave distance two feet Each also arranged ended right shaft pierced rock admission light air On examining carefully however I saw difference first escaped attention viz one tables left entered cave evidently used eat upon purposes embalming That beyond question case clear five shallow depressions stone table shaped like human form separate place head lie little bridge support neck depression different size fit bodies varying stature full grown man small child little holes bored intervals carry fluid And indeed confirmation required look wall cave find For sculptured round apartment looking nearly fresh day done pictorial representation death embalming burial old man long beard probably ancient king grandee country The first picture represented death He lying upon couch four short curved posts corners coming knob end appearance something like written notes music evidently act expiring Gathered round couch women children weeping former hair hanging backs The next scene represented embalmment body lay stark upon table depressions similar one us probably indeed picture table Three men employed work one superintending one holding funnel shaped exactly like port wine strainer narrow end fixed incision breast doubt great pectoral artery third depicted standing straddle legged corpse held kind large jug high hand poured steaming fluid fell accurately funnel The curious part sculpture man funnel man pours fluid drawn holding noses either I suppose stench arising body probably keep aromatic fumes hot fluid forced dead man veins Another curious thing I unable explain three men represented band linen tied round face holes eyes The third sculpture picture burial deceased There stiff cold clothed linen robe laid stone slab I slept upon first sojourning place At head feet burnt lamps side placed several beautiful painted vases I described perhaps supposed full provisions The little chamber crowded mourners musicians playing instrument resembling lyre near foot corpse stood man holding sheet preparing cover view These sculptures looked merely works art remarkable I make apology describing rather fully They struck also surpassing interest representing probably studious accuracy last rites dead practised among utterly lost people even I thought envious antiquarian friends Cambridge would ever I found opportunity describing wonderful remains Probably would say I exaggerating notwithstanding every page history must bear much internal evidence truth would obviously quite impossible invented To return As soon I hastily examined sculptures I think I omitted mention executed relief sat excellent meal boiled goat flesh fresh milk cakes made meal whole served upon clean wooden platters When eaten returned see Leo getting Billali saying must wait upon She hear commands On reaching Leo room found poor boy bad way He woke torpor altogether head babbling boat race Cam inclined violent Indeed entered room Ustane holding I spoke voice seemed soothe rate grew much quieter persuaded swallow dose quinine I sitting hour perhaps rate I know getting dark I could make head lying like gleam gold upon pillow extemporised bag covered blanket suddenly Billali arrived air great importance informed She deigned express wish see honour added accorded I think little horrified cool way taking honour fact I feel overwhelmed gratitude prospect seeing savage dusky queen however absolute mysterious might especially mind full dear Leo whose life I began great fears However I rose follow I I caught sight something bright lying floor I picked Perhaps reader remember potsherd casket composition scarabaelig us marked round O goose another curious hieroglyphic meaning Suten se Ra Royal Son Sun The scarab small one Leo insisted upon set massive gold ring generally used signets ring I picked He pulled paroxysm fever least I suppose flung upon rock floor Thinking I left might get lost I slipped little finger followed Billali leaving Job Ustane Leo We passed passage crossed great aisle like cave came corresponding passage side mouth guards stood like two statues As came bowed heads salutation lifting long spears placed transversely across foreheads leaders troop met us done ivory wands We stepped found exactly similar gallery led apartments passage comparatively speaking brilliantly lighted A paces met four mutes two men two women bowed low arranged women front men behind us order continued procession past several doorways hung curtains resembling leading quarters I afterwards found opened chambers occupied mutes attended She A paces came another doorway facing us left like others seemed mark termination passage Here two white rather yellow robed guards standing bowed saluted let us pass heavy curtains great antechamber quite forty feet long many wide eight ten women young handsome yellowish hair sat cushions working ivory needles appearance embroidery frames These women also deaf dumb At farther end great lamp lit apartment another doorway closed heavy Oriental looking curtains quite unlike hung doors rooms stood two particularly handsome girl mutes heads bowed upon bosoms hands crossed attitude humble submission As advanced stretched arm drew back curtains Thereupon Billali curious thing Down went venerable looking old gentleman Billali gentleman bottom hands knees undignified position long white beard trailing ground began creep apartment beyond I followed standing feet usual fashion Looking shoulder perceived Down son Baboon thy hands knees We enter presence She thou art humble surety blast thee thou standest I halted felt scared Indeed knees began give way mere motion reflection came aid I Englishman I asked I creep presence savage woman though I monkey fact well name I would could unless I absolutely sure life comfort depended upon If I began creep upon knees I always would patent acknowledgment inferiority So fortified insular prejudice kootooing like called prejudices good deal common sense recommend I marched boldly Billali I found another apartment considerably smaller anteroom walls entirely hung rich looking curtains make door work I subsequently discovered mutes sat antechamber wove strips afterwards sewn together Also room settees beautiful black wood ebony tribe inlaid ivory floor tapestries rather rugs At top end apartment appeared recess also draped curtains shone rays light There nobody place except Painfully slowly old Billali crept length cave dignified stride I could command I followed But I felt less failure To begin possible look dignified following wake old man writhing along stomach like snake order go sufficiently slowly either I keep leg seconds air every step else advance full stop stride like Mary Queen Scots going execution play Billali good crawling I suppose years stood way progress apartment long affair I immediately behind several times I sorely tempted help good kick It absurd advance presence savage royalty fashion Irishman driving pig market looked like idea nearly made burst laughing I work dangerous tendency unseemly merriment blowing nose proceeding filled old Billali horror looked shoulder made ghastly face I heard murmur Oh poor Baboon At last reached curtains Billali collapsed flat stomach hands stretched though dead I knowing began stare place But presently I clearly felt somebody looking behind curtains I could see person I could distinctly feel gaze produced odd effect upon nerves I frightened I know The place strange one true looked lonely notwithstanding rich hangings soft glow lamps indeed accessories added rather detracted loneliness lighted street night always solitary appearance dark one It silent place lay Billali like one dead heavy curtains odour perfume seemed float towards gloom arched roof Minute grew minute still sign life curtain move I felt gaze unknown sinking filling nameless terror till perspiration stood beads upon brow At length curtain began move Who could behind naked savage queen languishing Oriental beauty nineteenth century young lady drinking afternoon tea I slightest idea astonished seeing three I getting beyond astonishment The curtain agitated little suddenly folds appeared beautiful white hand white snow long tapering fingers ending pinkest nails The hand grasped curtain drew aside I heard voice I think softest yet silvery voice I ever heard It reminded murmur brook Stranger said voice Arabic much purer classical Arabic Amahagger talk stranger wherefore art thou much afraid Now I flattered spite inward terrors I kept fair command countenance therefore little astonished question Before I made mind answer however curtain drawn tall figure stood us I say figure body also face wrapped soft white gauzy material way first sight remind forcibly corpse grave clothes And yet I know given idea seeing wrappings thin one could distinctly see gleam pink flesh beneath I suppose owing way arranged either accidentally probably design Anyhow I felt frightened ever ghost like apparition hair began rise upon head feeling crept I presence something canny I could however clearly distinguish swathed mummy like form tall lovely woman instinct beauty every part also certain snake like grace I never seen anything equal When moved hand foot entire frame seemed undulate neck bend curved Why art thou frightened stranger asked sweet voice voice seemed draw heart like strains softest music Is affright man Then surely men changed used And little coquettish movement turned held one arm show loveliness rich hair raven blackness streamed soft ripples snowy robes almost sandalled feet It thy beauty makes fear oh Queen I answered humbly scarcely knowing say I thought I I heard old Billali still lying prostrate floor mutter Good Baboon good I see men still know beguile us women false words Ah stranger answered laugh sounded like distant silver bells thou wast afraid mine eyes searching thine heart therefore wast thou afraid Yet woman I forgive thee lie courteously said And tell came ye hither land dwellers among caves land swamps evil things dead old shadows dead What came ye see How ye hold

fought gallantly slain even I could called back life loosed body What means old man What hast thou say I give thee execute vengeance Her voice risen anger rang clear cold rocky walls Also I thought I

death till vanished They bowed humbly went departed old Billali gave friendly shake hand whispered rather I going wonderful expedition She must obeyed upon word I felt inclined agree In another minute gone briefly asked us ready Ayesha turned gazed towering cliff Goodness Leo I said surely going climb precipice Leo shrugged shoulders condition half fascinated half expectant mystification Ayesha sudden move began climb cliff course follow It perfectly marvellous see ease grace sprang rock rock swung along ledges The ascent however difficult seemed although one two nasty places look behind fact rock still sloped absolutely precipitous higher In way great labour mounted height fifty feet last standing place really troublesome thing manage Job board drew fifty sixty paces left starting point went like crab sideways Presently reached ledge narrow enough first widened followed moreover sloped inwards like petal flower followed gradually got kind rut fold rock grew deeper deeper till last resembled Devonshire lane stone hid us perfectly gaze anybody slope anybody gaze This lane appeared natural formation continued fifty sixty paces suddenly ended cave also natural running right angles I sure natural cave hollowed hand man irregular contorted shape course gave appearance blown bodily mountain frightful eruption gas following line least resistance All caves hollowed ancients Kocirc r contrary cut perfect regularity symmetry At mouth cave Ayesha halted bade us light two lamps I giving one keeping Then taking lead advanced cavern picking way great care indeed necessary floor irregular strewn boulders like bed stream places pitted deep holes would easy break one leg This cavern pursued twenty minutes far I could form judgment owing numerous twists turns easy task quarter mile long At last however halted farther end whilst I still trying pierce gloom great gust air came tearing extinguished lamps Ayesha called us crept little front rewarded view positively appalling gloom grandeur Before us mighty chasm black rock jagged torn splintered far past age awful convulsion Nature though cleft stroke upon stroke lightning This chasm bounded precipice hither presumably though could see farther side also may measured width across darkness I think broad It impossible make much outline far ran simple reason point standing far upper surface cliff least fifteen hundred two thousand feet dim light struggled us The mouth cavern following gave curious tremendous spur rock jutted mid air gulf us distance fifty yards coming sharp point termination resembling nothing I think much spur upon leg cock shape This huge spur attached parent precipice base course enormous cock spur attached leg Otherwise utterly unsupported Here must pass said Ayesha Be careful lest giddiness overcome wind sweep gulf beneath truth hath bottom without giving us time get scared started walking along spur leaving us follow best might I next came Job painfully dragging plank Leo brought rear It wonderful sight see intrepid woman gliding fearlessly along dreadful place For part I gone yards pressure air awful sense consequences slip would entail I found necessary go hands knees crawl two But Ayesha never condescended On went leaning body gusts wind never seeming lose head balance In minutes crossed twenty paces awful bridge got narrower every step sudden great gust came tearing along gorge I saw Ayesha lean strong draught got dark cloak tore away went wind flapping like wounded bird It dreadful see go till lost blackness I clung saddle rock looked round like living thing great spur vibrated humming sound beneath us The sight truly awesome one There poised gloom earth heaven Beneath us hundreds upon hundreds feet emptiness gradually grew darker till last absolutely black depth ended I guess Above space upon space giddy air far far away line blue sky And vast gulf upon pinnacled great draught dashed roared driving clouds misty wreaths vapour till nearly blinded utterly confused The whole position tremendous absolutely unearthly I believe actually lulled sense terror hour I often see dreams mere phantasy wake covered cold sweat On cried white form us cloak gone She robed white looked like spirit riding gale woman On ye fall dashed pieces Keep eyes fixed upon ground closely hug rock We obeyed crept painfully along quivering path wind shrieked wailed shook causing murmur like vast tuning fork On went I know long gazing round absolutely necessary last saw tip spur slab rock little larger ordinary table throbbed jumped like

dragged along us Before us empty space side something yet could see either owing shadow opposite cliff cause gloom night We must wait awhile called Ayesha soon light At moment I could imagine meant How could light ever come dreadful spot While I still wondering suddenly like great sword flame beam setting sun pierced Stygian gloom smote upon point rock whereon lay illumining Ayesha lovely form unearthly splendour I wish I could describe wild marvellous beauty sword fire laid across darkness rushing mist wreaths gulf How got I moment know I presume cleft hole opposing cliff pierced setting

board resting two moving supports I grew dizzy thought I must fall spine crept seemed I falling delight finding sprawling upon stone rose fell beneath like boat swell cannot expressed words All I know briefly earnestly enough I thanked Providence preserving far Then came Leo turn though looked rather queer came across like rope dancer Ayesha stretched hand clasp I heard say Bravely done love bravely done The old Greek spirit lives thee yet And poor Job remained farther side gulf He crept plank yelled I sir I shall fall beastly place You must I remember saying inappropriate facetiousness

accomplished order taking one lamps advanced towards end chamber roofed swaying stone halted We followed perceived wall cone stair accurate projecting knobs rock shaped form good imitation stair Down Ayesha began climb springing step step like chamois followed less grace When descended fifteen sixteen steps found ended tremendous rocky slope running first outwards inwards like slope inverted cone tunnel The slope steep often precipitous nowhere impassable light lamps went great difficulty though gloomy work enough travelling thus one us knew whither dead heart volcano As went however I took precaution noting route well I could difficult owing extraordinary fantastic shape rocks strewn many dim light looked like grim faces carven upon mediaelig val gargoyles ordinary boulders For long time travelled thus half hour I say till descended many hundreds feet I perceived reaching point inverted cone In another minute found apex funnel passage low narrow stoop crept along Indian file After fifty yards creeping passage suddenly widened cave huge could see neither roof sides We knew cave echo tread perfect quiet heavy air On went many minutes absolute awed silence like lost souls

Nor flashes came soul shaking sound like thunder crashing trees Now oh heavens We stood third cavern fifty feet length perhaps great height thirty wide It carpeted fine white sand walls worn smooth action I know The cavern dark like others filled soft glow rose coloured light beautiful look anything conceived But first saw flashes heard thunderous sound Presently however stood amaze gazing marvellous sight wondering whence rosy radiance flowed dread beautiful thing happened Across far end cavern grinding crashing noise noise dreadful awe inspiring trembled Job actually sank knees flamed awful cloud pillar fire like rainbow many coloured like lightning bright For space perhaps forty seconds flamed roared thus turning slowly round round degrees terrible noise ceased fire passed away I

waited utter silence At last far far away came first murmur sound grew grew till began crash bellow distance As heard Ayesha swiftly threw gauzy wrapping loosened golden snake kirtle shaking lovely hair like garment beneath cover slipped kirtle replaced snaky belt around outside masses falling hair There stood us Eve might stood Adam clad nothing abundant locks held round golden band words mine tell sweet looked yet divine Nearer nearer came thunder wheels fire came pushed one ivory arm dark masses hair flung round Leo neck Oh love love murmured wilt thou ever know I loved thee kissed forehead went stood pathway flame Life There I remember mind something touching words embrace upon forehead It like mother kiss seemed convey benediction On came crashing rolling noise sound sound forest swept flat mighty wind tossed like much grass thundered mountain side Nearer nearer came flashes light forerunners revolving pillar flame passing like arrows rosy air edge pillar appeared Ayesha turned towards stretched arms greet On came slowly lapped round flame I saw fire run form I saw lift hands though water pour head I even saw open mouth draw lungs dread wonderful sight Then paused stretched arms stood quite still heavenly smile upon face though Spirit Flame The mysterious fire played dark rolling locks twining twisting around like threads golden lace gleamed upon ivory breast shoulder hair slipped aside slid along pillared throat delicate features seemed find home glorious eyes shone shone brightly even spiritual essence Oh beautiful looked flame No angel heaven could worn greater loveliness Even heart faints recollection stood smiled awed faces I would give half remaining time upon earth see like But suddenly suddenly I describe kind change came face change I could define explain none less change The smile vanished place came dry hard look rounded face seemed grow pinched though great anxiety leaving impress upon The glorious eyes lost light I thought form perfect shape erectness I rubbed eyes thinking I victim hallucination refraction intense light produced optical delusion I flaming pillar slowly twisted thundered whithersoever passes bowels great earth leaving Ayesha standing As soon gone stepped forward Leo side seemed spring step stretched hand lay shoulder I gazed arm Where wonderful roundness beauty It getting thin angular And face Heaven face growing old eyes I suppose Leo saw also certainly recoiled step two What Kallikrates said voice matter deep thrilling notes They quite high cracked Why said confusedly I feel dazed Surely

Forget Kallikrates Have pity shame I shall come shall beautiful I swear true Oh h h fell upon face still On spot twenty centuries slain Kallikrates priest fell died I know long remained thus Many hours I suppose When last I opened eyes two still outstretched upon floor The rosy light yet beamed like celestial dawn thunder wheels Spirit Life yet rolled upon accustomed track I awoke great pillar passing away There lay hideous little monkey frame covered crinkled yellow parchment glorious She Alas hideous dream awful unparalleled fact What happened bring shocking change Had nature life giving Fire changed Did perhaps time time send forth essence Death instead essence Life Or frame charged marvellous virtue could bear process repeated mattered lapse time two impregnations neutralised left body acted ever came contact essence Life This alone would account sudden terrible ageing Ayesha whole length two thousand years took effect upon I slightest doubt frame lying frame woman would extraordinary means life could preserved till length died age two twenty centuries But tell happened There fact Often since awful hour I reflected requires great imagination see finger Providence matter Ayesha locked living tomb waiting age age coming lover worked small change order World But Ayesha strong happy love clothed immortal youth goddess beauty wisdom centuries would revolutionised society even perchance changed destiny Mankind Thus opposed eternal law strong though swept back nothingness swept back shame hideous mockery For minutes I lay faintly turning terrors mind physical strength came back quickly buoyant atmosphere Then I bethought others staggered feet see I could arouse But first I took Ayesha kirtle gauzy scarf wont hide dazzling loveliness eyes men averting head I might look upon covered dreadful relic glorious dead shocking epitome human beauty human life I hurriedly fearing lest Leo recover see Then stepping perfumed masses dark hair lay upon sand I stooped Job lying upon face turned As I arm fell back way I like sent chill I glanced sharply One look enough Our old faithful servant dead His nerves already shattered seen undergone utterly broken beneath last dire sight died terror fit brought terror I look face see It another blow perhaps may help people understand overwhelmingly awful experience passed feel much time It seemed quite natural poor

nature exact causes produced result course ignorant Well boy I said cannot stop till go way two I pointed little heap white garment stiffing corpse poor Job If going better go But way I expect lamps burnt I took one looked sure enough There oil vase said Leo indifferently broken least I examined vessel question intact With trembling hand I filled lamps luckily still linen wick unburnt Then I lit one wax matches While I heard pillar fire approaching went never ending journey indeed pillar passed repassed circle Let see come said Leo shall never look upon like world It seemed bit idle curiosity somehow I shared waited till turning slowly round upon axis flamed thundered I remember wondering many thousands years phenomenon taking place bowels earth many thousands would continue take place I wondered also mortal eyes would ever mark passage mortal ears thrilled fascinated swelling volume majestic sound I think I believe last human beings ever see unearthly sight Presently gone turned go But took Job cold hand shook It rather ghastly ceremony means power showing respect faithful dead celebrating obsequies The heap beneath white garment uncover We wish look upon terrible sight But went

tremendous gulf How cross without plank There one answer must try jump else stop till starved The distance great eleven twelve feet I think I seen Leo jump twenty young fellow collage think conditions Two weary worn men one wrong side forty rocking stone take trembling point rock feet across land upon bottomless gulf cleared raging gale It bad enough God knows I pointed things Leo put whole matter nutshell replying merciless choice must choose certainty lingering death chamber risk swift one air Of course arguing one thing clear could attempt leap dark thing wait ray light pierced gulf sunset How near far sunset might neither us faintest notion know last light came would endure couple minutes outside must prepared meet Accordingly made minds creep top rocking stone lie readiness We easily reconciled course fact lamps nearly exhausted indeed one gone bodily jumping flame lamp oil done So aid dying light hastened crawl little chamber clamber side great stone As light went The difference position sufficiently remarkable one Below little chamber heard roaring gale overhead lying faces swinging stone exposed full force fury great draught drew first direction howling mighty precipice rocky cliffs like ten thousand despairing souls We lay hour hour terror misery mind deep I attempt describe listened wild storm voices Tartarus set deep undertone spur opposite wind hummed like awful harp called precipice precipice No nightmare dreamed man wild invention romancer ever equal living horror place weird crying voices night clung like shipwrecked mariners raft tossed black unfathomed wilderness air Fortunately temperature low one indeed wind warm perished So clung listened stretched upon rock thing happened curious suggestive though doubtless mere coincidence anything added rather deducted burden nerves It remembered Ayesha standing spur crossed stone wind tore cloak whirled away darkness gulf could see whither Well I hardly like tell story strange As lay upon rocking stone cloak came floating black space like memory dead fell Leo covered nearly head foot We could first make soon discovered feel poor Leo first time gave way I heard sobbing upon stone No doubt cloak caught upon pinnacle cliff thence blown hither chance gust still curious touching incident Shortly suddenly without slightest previous warning great red knife light came stabbing darkness struck swaying stone rested sharp point upon spur opposite Now said Leo never We rose stretched looked cloud wreaths stained colour blood red ray tore sickening depths beneath empty space swaying stone quivering rock hearts despaired prepared death Surely could clear desperate though Who go first said I Do old fellow answered Leo I sit upon side stone steady You must take much run jump high God mercy us say I I acquiesced nod I thing I never done since Leo little boy I turned put arm round kissed forehead It sounds rather French fact I taking last farewell man I could loved son twice Good bye boy I said I hope shall meet wherever go The fact I expect live another two minutes Next I retreated far side rock waited till one chopping gusts wind got behind I ran length huge stone three four thirty feet sprang wildly dizzy air Oh sickening terrors I felt I launched little point rock horrible sense despair shot brain I realised I jumped short feet never touched point went space hands body came contact I gripped yell one hand slipped I swung right round holding I faced stone I sprung Wildly I stretched left hand time managed grasp knob rock I hung fierce red light thousands feet empty air beneath My hands holding either side part spur point touching head Therefore even I could found strength I could pull The I could would hang minute drop bottomless pit If man imagine hideous position let speak All I know torture half minute nearly turned brain I heard Leo give cry suddenly saw mid air springing like chamois It splendid leap took influence terror despair clearing horrible gulf nothing landing well rocky point threw upon face prevent pitching depths I felt spur shake beneath shock impact I saw huge rocking stone violently depressed sprang fly back relieved weight till first time centuries got beyond balance fell awful crash right rocky chamber served philosopher Noot hermitage I doubt ever sealed passage leads Place Life hundreds tons rock All happened second curiously enough notwithstanding terrible position I noted involuntarily I even remember thinking human would go dread path Next instant I felt Leo seize right wrist hands By lying flat point rock could reach You must let go swing clear said calm collected voice I try pull go together Are ready By way answer I let go first left hand right consequence swayed clear overshadowing rock weight hanging upon Leo arms It dreadful moment He powerful man I knew would strength equal lifting till I could get hold top spur owing position little purchase For seconds I swung fro gathered effort I heard sinews cracking felt lifted though I little child till I got left arm round rock chest resting The rest easy two three seconds I lying panting side side trembling like leaves cold perspiration terror pouring skins And light went like lamp For half hour lay thus without speaking word length began creep along great spur best might dense gloom As drew towards face cliff however spur sprang like spike wall light increased though little night overhead After gusts wind decreased got along rather better last reached mouth first cave tunnel But fresh trouble stared face oil gone lamps doubt crushed powder beneath fallen rocking stone We even without drop water stay thirst drunk last chamber Noot How see make way last boulder strewn tunnel Clearly could trust sense feeling attempt passage dark crept fearing delayed exhaustion would overcome us probably lie die Oh horrors last tunnel The place strewn rocks fell knocked till bleeding score wounds Our guide side cavern kept touching bewildered grow darkness several times seized terrifying thought turned travelling wrong way On went feebly still feebly hour hour stopping every minutes rest strength spent Once fell asleep I think must slept hours woke limbs quite stiff blood blows scratches caked hard dry upon skin Then dragged till last despair entering hearts saw light day found outside tunnel rocky fold outer surface cliff remembered led It early morning could tell feel sweet air look blessed sky never hoped see It near knew hour sunset entered tunnel followed taken us entire night crawl dreadful place One effort Leo I gasped shall reach slope Billali gone Come give way cast upon face He rose leaning got fifty feet cliff somehow I least notion I remember found lying heap bottom began drag along hands knees towards grove She told Billali wait arrival could walk another foot We gone fifty yards fashion suddenly one mutes emerged trees left I presume taking morning stroll came running see sort strange animals He stared stared held hands horror nearly fell ground Next started hard could grove two hundred yards away No wonder horrified appearance must shocking sight To begin Leo golden curls turned snowy white clothes nearly rent body worn face hands mass bruises cuts blood encrusted filth sufficiently alarming spectacle painfully dragged along ground I doubt I little better look I know two days afterwards I inspected face water I scarcely recognised I never famous beauty something beside ugliness stamped upon features I never got rid day something resembling wild look startled person wakes deep sleep anything else I think And really wondered What I wonder escaped reason Presently intense relief I saw old Billali hurrying towards us even I could scarcely help smiling expression consternation dignified countenance Oh Baboon Baboon cried dear son indeed thee Lion Why mane ripe corn white like snow Whence come ye Pig She must obeyed Dead dead I answered ask questions help us give us food water shall die thine eyes Seest thou tongues black want water How talk Dead gasped Impossible She never dies dead perceiving I think face watched mutes come running checked motioned carry us camp Fortunately arrived broth boiling fire Billali fed us weak feed thereby I firmly believe saving us death exhaustion Then bade mutes wash blood grime us wet cloths laid upon piles aromatic grass instantly fell dead sleep absolute exhaustion mind body XXVIII OVER THE MOUNTAIN The next thing I recollect feeling dreadful stiffness sort vague idea passing half awakened brain I carpet beaten I opened eyes first thing fell venerable countenance old friend Billali seated side improvised bed upon I sleeping thoughtfully stroking long beard The sight brought back mind recollection recently passed accentuated vision poor Leo lying opposite face knocked almost jelly beautiful crowd curls turned yellow white [*] I shut eyes groaned [*] Curiously enough Leo hair lately extent regaining colour say yellowish grey I without hopes time come quite right L H H Thou hast slept long Baboon said old Billali How long father I asked A round sun round moon day night hast thou slept Lion also See sleepeth yet Blessed sleep I answered swallows recollection Tell said hath befallen strange story death Her dieth Bethink thee son true thy danger danger Lion great nay almost pot red wherewith ye

Hiya terrible One must obeyed slay ye pot But let hear thy tale poor Baboon Thus adjured I set work told everything indeed I think desirable sufficient purpose make understand She really fallen fire I put real thing would incomprehensible burnt I also told horrors undergone effecting escape produced great impression But I clearly saw believe report Ayesha death He believed indeed thought dead explanation suited disappear Once said father time done twelve years tradition country many centuries back one seen whole generation suddenly reappeared destroyed woman assumed position Queen I said nothing shook head sadly Alas I knew well Ayesha would appear rate Billali would never see And concluded Billali wouldst thou Baboon Nay I said I know father Can escape country He shook head It difficult By Kocirc r ye cannot pass ye would seen soon fierce ones found ye alone well smiled significantly made movement though placing hat head But way cliff whereof I spake thee drive cattle pasture Then beyond pastures three days journey marshes I know I heard seven days journey thence mighty river floweth black water If ye could come thither perchance ye might escape ye come thither Billali I said thou knowest I save thy life Now pay back debt father save mine friend Lion It shall pleasant thing thee think thine hour comes something set scale evil thy days perchance thou hast done evil Also thou right She doth hide surely comes shall reward thee My son Baboon answered old man think I ungrateful heart Well I remember thou didst rescue dogs stood see drown Measure measure I

might expected appearance us managed eat hearty meal indeed needed sadly enough After limped spring bathed came back slept till evening ate enough five Billali away day doubt making arrangements litters bearers awakened middle night arrival considerable number men little camp At dawn old man appeared told us using She dreadful name though difficulty succeeded getting necessary men two guides conduct us across swamps urged us start time announcing intention accompanying us protect us treachery I much touched act kindness part wily old barbarian towards two utterly defenceless strangers A

rites far terrible savages I ever heard people kindly hearts Of course self interest may something He may thought She would suddenly reappear demand account us hands still allowing deductions great deal could expect circumstances I say I shall long I live cherish affectionate remembrance nominal parent old Billali Accordingly swallowing food started litters feeling far bodies went wonderfully

described For three whole days stench mire prevailing flavour fear bearers struggle along till length came open rolling ground quite uncultivated mostly treeless covered game sorts lies beyond desolate without guides utterly impracticable district And following morning bade farewell without regret old Billali stroked white beard solemnly blessed us Farewell son Baboon said farewell thee oh Lion I help But ever ye come country advised venture lands ye know lest ye come back leave white bones mark limit journeyings Farewell often shall I think wilt thou forget Baboon though thy face ugly
